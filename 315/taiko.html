				<p class="description draculaPurple" style="font-size: 30px; word-wrap: normal">So you want to learn more about the Taiko no Tatsujin Converter right?
                The documentation that is listed here is meant to work within the context of reading binary files in hex format. Use HxD please.
                </p>
                <p class="description draculaPurple" style="font-size: 30px; word-wrap: normal"> Please keep in mind that this is inteded for little endian, so yo must reverese your hex bytes.
                Conversion to wii games requires using big endian</p>

                000-1AF - This is the files header. It should be copied and pasted form other official file headers. It also contains the info regarding the timing windows for the charts.

                <p class="description draculaPurple" style="font-size: 30px;  word-wrap: normal">

                Most of the format was actually received from Chinese hackers of the game. They sent us the byte addresses for each relevant part of the game, but it was all in Chinese, and thus required a lot of figuring out on our own what they meant. They also did not explain how to pack these binary files, which involved a process of having to compress them with the lz11 format. In addition, we also had to figure out the specific way of creating aac files and replacing the header with Bandai Namco's proprietary header.

                    My favorite part of this project was trying to reverse engineer how measures work.
                    In real life music, music can often have changes in tempo or time signature, and it was completely clear how these were implemented
                    What I discovered was that they would make the measures actually overlap with each other in order to create the illusion of a 3/4 measure or append a barless measure in order to create a 5/4 measure. It was pretty interesting to nbe able to discover some programmer's implementation of musical notation through reverse engineering.
