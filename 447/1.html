        <h1>This is one helpful/insightful visualization.</h1>

        <h2>I particularly think this visualization is useful because it allows us to see hte movement of particles in a video, rather than a still image. This way, the chaotic nature of ocean particle movement is well conveyed.</h2>

        <h2>This visualization is a visualization of a redditor's rubik's cube solve times over attempts. I think this visualization is particularly bad because the axis's are not labeled, the legends are not explained whatsoever, and the colors are confusing.</h2>
